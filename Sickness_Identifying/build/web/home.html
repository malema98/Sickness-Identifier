				<p>Sickness identifying Application is a web-based platform application for detecting or identifying sicknesses within the human’s body. 
                                    This software is intended to help users identify the sickness that attacked them by a way of them telling the software app the possible symptoms 
                                    they are feeling, and the system will associate those systems with possible sickness that attacked them and the causes of those sicknesses. 
                                    The idea about the system came after realizing that Most African people are dying out of sickness, they do not have knowledge about, they tend to be ignorant about sickness because they do not know the cause and the treatment for it. Some sickness multiply rapidly and causes more damages to the human when taken no treatment against them, the idea was brought into the table to help the users find the sicknesses that they are suffering from without consulting the official Health Practitioner but browsing through App without consulting Fee cost. Furthermore, 
                                    the app is intended to educate our African people about the disease that attacked them and the possible ways to fight them. This software will play a significant role in people’s live as it will serve a reminder/alert
                                    for consuming medication and doctors’ appointments for which that will make people take full responsibility and care for their sicknesses.  </p>
